# Minnesota Department of Transportation Project

### Project                                                                     

**BI Analyst:** Stuart Greenley

**Client/Sponsor:** Minnesota Department of Transportation dashboard

**Purpose:** Their goal is to learn more about traffic patterns

**Key dependencies:** Understand the following:
1. Understand what deliverables are required
2. Understand the business question being answered
3. Collect data for project

**Stakeholder requirements:**

|Business problem: | Knowing traffic patterns under these conditions will help the team make important infrastructure decisions. Knowing construction in the future won’t cause problems for drivers.|
|---|---|
|Stakeholders:  (Who are the major stakeholders of this project, and what are their job titles?)| |
|Stakeholder usage details: (How will the stakeholders use the BI tool?)
|Primary requirements: | Create a dashboard with the following 
a. Traffic volume throughout the year; ideally organized by year, month, week, day, and hour
b. Traffic volume in different weather conditions
c.  Traffic volume on different holidays |





(List the established stakeholder requirements, based on the Stakeholder Requirements Document. Prioritize the requirements as: R - required, D - desired, or N - nice to have.)
Success criteria: (Clarify what success looks like for this project. Include explicit statements about how to measure success. Use SMART criteria.) 
User journeys: (Document the current user experience and the ideal future experience.)
Assumptions: (Explicitly and clearly state any assumptions you are making.)
Compliance and privacy: (Include compliance, privacy, or legal dimensions to consider.)
Accessibility: (List key considerations for creating accessible reports for all users.)
Roll-out plan: (Detail the expected scope, priorities and timeline

Strategy 
Which parts of the dataset will enable you to address the business requirement? Which measures and dimensions will be represented in each chart? Which chart types and forms of encoding will be most effective? And how many charts are required?

Primary dataset: Metro_Interstate_Traffic_Volume
Secondary dataset: 
User Profiles [Who is the intended audience for this dashboard? How do you expect them to use this dashboard?]
    
Dashboard Functionality
Dashboard Feature
Your Request
Reference dashboard
(Should this dashboard be modeled on an existing dashboard? If so, provide a link and describe the similarity.)


Access
(How should access to the dashboard be limited? Who needs to have access?)


Scope
(What data should be included or excluded in this dashboard?)


Date filters and granularity
(Should the dashboard include date filters? If so, what time frame should be displayed by default? Should the dashboard include a “granularity” drop-down? If so, what granularity should be selected by default?)




Metrics and Charts
Create a table for each chart that you’d like to include in the dashboard. If you’d like to break the dashboard under different headers, feel free to list those here as well.
