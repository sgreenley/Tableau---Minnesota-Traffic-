**BI Analyst:** Stuart Greenley

**Client/Sponsor:** Minnesota Department of Transportation dashboard

**Purpose:** Their goal is to learn more about traffic patterns

**Key dependencies:** Understand the following:
1. Understand what deliverables are required
2. Understand the business question being answered
3. Collect data for project

**Stakeholder requirements:**

| Stakeholder Requirements | Notes |
|---|---|
|Business problem: | Knowing traffic patterns under these conditions will help the team make important infrastructure decisions. Knowing construction in the future wonâ€™t cause problems for drivers.|
|Stakeholders:  (Who are the major stakeholders of this project, and what are their job titles?)| |
|Stakeholder usage details: (How will the stakeholders use the BI tool?)
|Primary requirements: | Create a dashboard with the following 1. Traffic volume throughout the year; ideally organized by year, month, week, day, and hour 2. Traffic volume in different weather conditions 3. Traffic volume on different holidays |

(List the established stakeholder requirements, based on the Stakeholder Requirements Document. Prioritize the requirements as: R - required, D - desired, or N - nice to have.)

**Key Questions to answer for the dashboard:**

1. Which parts of the dataset will enable you to address the business requirement?
2. Which measures and dimensions will be represented in each chart?
3. Which chart types and forms of encoding will be most effective?
4. And how many charts are required?

**Primary dataset:** Metro_Interstate_Traffic_Volume

**Date filters and granularity:**
